- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a desaturated hue of the primary color, provides a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Green (#34A853), analogous to blue, to highlight calls to action and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure readability and a contemporary feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets clearly. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist and clear icons that represent different academic subjects. Favor the Feather icon set, if possible, or alternatively Material Design.
